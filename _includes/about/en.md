Hi, I'm @carloseguevara (Carlos Guevara), an Actuary Data Engineer and true
enthusiast of using Vim, creating robust solutions and sharing knowledge.

Currently, I'm working on producing my blog using the amazing @huxpro
development, with the goal of sharing my knowledge on things that are not so
well documented on the web and create an applied version of hexagonal
architecture in the data engineer world.

I have had the opportunity to use tools like:

- Programming languages:
    - R
    - Python
    - Scala
    - SQL
    - Lua
- Open-Source tools:
    - Docker
    - Kubernetes
    - Airflow
- Cloud solutions:
    - Amazon Web Service (AWS)
    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Big Data:
    - PySpark
    - AWS Glue
- Visualization Tools:
    - PowerBI
    - Tableau
    - Looker
